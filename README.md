# Portfolio (HTML/CSS Only)
> This HTML/CSS-only portfolio is the first project I created for Coding Temple, 
the full-stack software engineering bootcamp I attended. This was my first attempt
at using HTML and CSS to share a little about myself.

> You can find a live demo [_here_](https://marlisarebaum.github.io/prework-portfolio/).

## General Information
The task for this project was to use CSS grid and create a simple HTML and CSS 
portfolio. The purpose was to practice using CSS grid and be creative with the 
styling to really show who we are. The portfolio had to include the following:

- a navbar
- a hero image with text
- "about me" section
- at least one use of CSS grid
- (non-functional) contact form

I used this project as an opportunity to get creative with my CSS. For example,
I practiced rotating text using transform: rotate(-10deg) and practice having an
offset border on my images, played around with transparency, etc.
