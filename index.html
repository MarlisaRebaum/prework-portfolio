                <h1>Hello,</h1>
                <h2>so lovely to meet you!</h2>
                <p>You know that little emoji with the head exploding and brain
                     popping out of it? That describes me right now. As you are 
                     reading this, I most likely look exactly like that while 
                     staring at my computer while simultaneously stress-baking 
                     a cake that, if eaten in its entirety, will make all of my 
                     stress vanish in the form of a food-coma later this 
                     evening. I have taken on a new challenge of becoming a 
                     web developer and although I am so grateful and excited 
                     for the opportunity, it is unlike anything I have ever 
                     done.
                </p>
                <p>During high school, when I first considered the possibility 
                    of even going to college, I felt that as a woman, technical 
                    fields were never presented as an option from my career 
                    advisors. I ended up earning both a bachelor's and master's 
                    degree in teaching. Through my extensive college 
                    experience, I learned that although I enjoy being a 
                    teacher in terms of helping others learn new materials, 
                    supporting others in their learning goals, and using 
                    creative problem solving to make the classroom and learning 
                    run more smoothly, I do not so much enjoy teaching in a 
                    traditional classroom. As I have grown more confident in my 
                    skills and abilities through my education, I have also 
                    gained the confidence to go outside my comfort zone and 
                    explore other career opportunities that align more with 
                    my long-term dreams and passions.
                </p>
                <p>I want to be a software developer because it allows me to 
                    use a combination of creative thinking and problem solving. 
                    As I am a firm believer of lifelong learning, I am excited 
                    for a career that allows many opportunities for 
                    professional and personal growth. I know this journey is 
                    going to be difficult, but I am excited to start on an 
                    exciting, new careers path.

                <p>I love taking pictures of animals, nature, and people. I am 
                    self-taught but would love to take classes one day to hone my 
                    skills.</p>

                <p>Although some may call this my side-hustle, I love dog 
                    sitting. I love getting to have a little pooch to hang 
                    out with, without the responsibility of finding someone to 
                    watch them when I want to travel. </p>

                <p>I love the healing and re-energizing power of nature. 
                    Spending a weekend out by a lake, just with friends or my 
                    partner, is the perfect way to recharge from a busy week.</p>
